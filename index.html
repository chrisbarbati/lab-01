        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in 1998, in Toronto at Women's College Hospital.
        </p>

        <p>
            I attended St. James elementary school and St. Thomas Aquinas secondary school.
            I was briefly in the Engineering program at Western University,
            before deciding it wasn't for me. I like building things, but
            I did not want to do math all day.<br><br>
            I then came to <em>Georgian College</em> and enrolled in the BBML program,
            of which I completed about three semesters before transferring
            to <em>York University's</em> Economics program. Ironically, I <em>still</em> ended
            up in a program where I did math all day.
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed my degree in Economics this summer, and recently started
            the CMPA program at <em>Georgian College</em>. I have some amateur experience in
            programming, but have always had trouble taking my skills to the next
            level on my own. I'm hoping that I can grow my abilities and gain
            experience through the co-op periods, then start a career in programming.
